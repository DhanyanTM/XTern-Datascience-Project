Food Truck itinerary plan

In this project, I used Google to make a food truck dataset with the recommended columns. It captures Latitude and Longitude of a given food truck.

This helps with calculating distances between various destinations (using Geopy python library), which I have tried to minimize. 

I have ensured that on Day_1 we have a day tour and on Day_2, we explore the city at night. The food trucks are chosen such that their hours of operation fit this criterion.

Also, I have planned the itinerary in a way that there is no redundancy in travel. In other words, travel is unidirectional. 

Check out my python code "FoodTrucks_Database_Itinerary_planner.ipynb for more details.
